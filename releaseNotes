Improvements

- Density added to liquid compounds

- Allow molar-molar conversion using stock without knowing molar mass

- Disabled mg/ml concentrations for liquids

- Changing and limiting stock possibility according to desired concentration settings

- Message : Molar mass not entered.

- Message : Density required to obtain ml.

Fixes

- Fixed liquid with molar concentration - result in grams unless the density is specified

- Fixed : More space for long compound names in title
